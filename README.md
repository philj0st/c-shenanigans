# c-shenanigans
just me implementing some stuff in C

### Watch

added watch.js to watch for changes in \*.c files and automatically compile and run them.

to use the watch script run `npm install` to install dependencies and then start it with `node watch.js` (assuming you have `node` and `npm` installed)
